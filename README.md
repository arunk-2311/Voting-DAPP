# Voting-DAPP
This is a voting decentralised application powered by ethereum blockchain.
The framework used is brownie:A python based framework.The smart contracts are written by solidity.
The application has been tested for its usage,the tests can be overlooked in the test folder.

# Usage
Since i am an One piece anime fan,i have arranged the votes to be put as in brownie-vote_like_this.yaml,and the candidates have been set in brownie-config.yaml.
If you are a fan of some other anime or otherwise,tweak around with those terms and you will be there!.

# Further-improvement:
A Front-end could be added via react,i will soon update that too!,and to make things simpler,we have the whole contract run on a local blockchain,but with little expertise you can tweak it to work in any test-net or main-net.But in Future,i will add that too!
