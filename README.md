# Voting-DAPP
This is a voting decentralised application powered by ethereum blockchain.

The framework used is brownie:A python based framework.The smart contracts are written by solidity.

The application has been tested for its usage,the tests can be overlooked in the test folder.

# Further-improvement:
A Front-end could be added via react,i will soon update that too!,and to make things simpler,we have the whole contract run on a local blockchain,but with little expertise you can tweak it to work in any test-net or main-net.But in Future,i will add that too!
